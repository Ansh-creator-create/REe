       The harry potter movie series is my favourite movie series which i watched with my mom as the concept of a little boy who's mom and dad were killed by the great evil then one day after being adopted by his uncle and aunt and being treated unfairly hagrid from the magic world who bought harry to them comes back for harry and tells him he is a wizard harry is of course surprised and then is enrolled at hogwarts yet harry meets ron weasly and hermione gringer they have became friends soon enough harry potter in the course of t he next year has got a break from school instead of being trapped in the room he always is DOBBY appears harrys aunt and uncles are down stairs with guests harry comes down after dobby destroys a cake (ugh dobby what in the world was going in your mind?) dobby just wanted harry to leave hogwarts anyways then harry is rescued then they go to hog wartss (stealing ron's dad's car because they couldnt get to the train in the process ) then harry is met with the TOM RIDDLE's diary harry potter has been being talked by snakes and speaks the language of snakes in his class soon harry potter is met with a diary which SPEAKS harry writes something in it asking if it knows about chamber of secrets the diary replies: "Maybe" soon they find out people are being targetted most noteable are:
        drake malfoy's cat.
        soon treated with all this harry speaks the language of snakes near his school fountain and it opens him to the chamber ron and him (and a proffeser) jump in the proffeser threatens to kill the young kids,Then he hit with a brick harry goes to the other side and he wakes up *clap* *clap* 
        prof: hi 
        ron: hi 
        prof: who am I?
        ron: *BRICK SMACK*
        ok now harry goes down the chamber cause ron is ya know he is greeted with tom riddle using hermione to summon the monster of the chamber anywaysssss so harry fights the monster and destroys the diary rescues hermione runs away with ron and the prof and the prof goes like riding on a broom: WOW THIS IS JUST LIKE MAGIC!
